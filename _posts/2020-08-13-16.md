<h1>Why it SUCKS to be a Millennial</h1>
<p>If you ask our parents they would say we are entitled, but that’s not entirely true.</p>
<p>If you look at previous generations it’s true that they didn’t have a lot of the luxuries of the modern world that we are living in today, they didn’t grow up with the internet, or smart phones, social media, Netflix, or computers really. There is one glaring difference though, previous generations didn’t have to clean up the mess of the generations that came before them. I’m not talking about politics, empires have risen and fallen and it would be false to say that previous generations didn’t have problems, whether it be food shortages or war, but those problems were generally isolated, perhaps to millions of people, but that’s still an isolated problem compared to the issues we face today. The new generations will have to fight to clean up the earth, something that started with a few factories over the first and second industrial revolutions has become globalization, and it affects billions.</p>
<p>Everyone knows what I’m talking about, it’s nothing new, but one perspective recently came over me like a wave. Never before has the world been poisoned by a generation with the expectation that their children and grandchildren would clean it up after them. There has never been as selfish or entitled a generation as the baby boomers. What is so shocking to me about this revelation is that I’ve heard it my entire life that every generation has had to pick up the pieces of the previous one, that the expectation being placed on us to deal with the issues created by our parents was something true of every generation before us, but looking at history, that is one of the most bold faced lies I have ever been told.</p>
<p>I have never in my life been somewhere that I haven’t seen human trash, ever. I started noticing this when I was in my late teens and it’s been something that I couldn’t un-notice. Next time you are out exploring nature, take a hard look around, do you see trash? It’s everywhere, literally everywhere, it’s on the bottom of the ocean, it’s on the moon, it’s micro plastic in our table salt, it’s circling the earth as space debris, it’s in our air and water and food, it’s even in our bodies. If you take an honest look around, it’s rare that you can’t see human trash, no matter which direction you look.</p>
<h3>What are we supposed to do? 🤷‍♂️</h3>
<p>Well, our parents don’t have an answer for us, and mostly they don’t care. I know my parents have the attitude that they will be dead before they have to deal with it and will tell me that it’s my generations responsibility to figure it out. I haven’t seen anything that seems to be a large enough effort to solve these problems, and I can’t say the world seems to want to make that effort. I have a few suggestions though…</p>
<h3>1. Companies that produce plastic trash need to be responsible for recycling that trash. ♻️</h3>
<p>I use the term “trash” because less than 10% of plastics ever get recycled. Recycling was a term introduced by bottling companies to put the onus on the customer to deal with the plastic that these companies were producing. Recycling programs made it the government’s responsibility to ensure recycling worked. And how about the companies that produced the plastic you ask, well they were able to wipe their hands of any responsibility.
This may seem silly but if every company that produced a glass or plastic or cardboard container was required to pay for the recycling program for that container, perhaps we would fix the broken recycling system, and at the very least they would have to reconsider the materials that they are using in their packaging. Perhaps we should impose environmental fines for any materials used that could not be recycled, and these fines should be greater than the environmental cost being incurred by future generations.</p>
<h3>2. Reusable packaging 🥡</h3>
<p>If you wanted to take this a step further, you’d venture beyond simple recycling, to reuse. If you remember the age old wisdom of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, then you know this actually comes before recycling, but alas our planet has nearly forgotten this mantra so I’m working through it backwards.
Imagine if you walked into a shop for the first time, and they used a standard container, and they charged you for that container, unless you brought one in exchange. A system like this, with containers that are reusable, could take out a huge chunk of plastic, glass and cardboard trash.</p>
<p>Imagine if there was a company that produced a standardized set of containers, that you could save money by reusing, or get a portion of that cost back by returning it to a “Reuse Facility”. I know these don’t exist today but just imagine for a second with me if rather than recycling, we focused our efforts on reuse. Sure plastic companies would take a hit, but I already don’t care much for them, and this would create a whole new industry, perhaps a bit more labor intensive, that could provide tons of new jobs while REDUCING our carbon footprint. People would intuitively become more aware of the carbon footprint they are creating by actively engaging in the process, and not to mention, paying for it when they don’t.</p>
<h3>3. Start Gardening 🥦</h3>
<p>What was once considered America’s favorite hobby has become a bit of a dinosaur, people are so accustomed to buying everything they need that they have lost touch with the earth.</p>
<p>Imagine if you went to the grocery and instead of buying rosemary or thyme or basil or some other herb, that you bought instead a plant, with soil, in a pot, with whatever herb you wanted growing out of it. Imagine if you got home and you added this plant to your little backyard garden, or front yard garden, or rooftop, or windowsill garden. Imagine if your fire escape was filled with plants that you and your neighbors worked together to grow and could share and literally had a produce section a few steps away from your kitchen.</p>
<p>Imagine if you didn’t have to burn fuel to drive your car to the grocery, where they had lights and refrigerators keeping your veggies healthy long enough for them to be sold, that had been transported potentially half way around the world, burning fuel to get them there, after coming from a factory farm, that had to clear an ancient forest to grow your genetically modified tomatoes, so that two out of four could rot in your fridge, while you spend precious energy keeping them cool.</p>
<h3>It’s not Rocket Science 🚀</h3>
<p>… but it does require change, and some conscious thought. Some of these, like gardening, you can start today. Making an effort to get yourself your own reusable containers is something that you can at least start doing at your local grocery or farmers market. Reformed recycling programs and companies switching to reusable containers will require more serious conversation and innovation, but are not impossible. If you are a Millennial or a Gen Z, have this conversation with your parents, sit them down and make sure that together you start using environmentally friendly products, swap that soap, change those light bulbs, turn the a/c up a notch, maybe even get them to look at trying solar panels, because you will have to pay the price down the road if you don’t. One day we will look back on the world we grew up in and laugh about how we could have ever been so wasteful… one day…</p>
