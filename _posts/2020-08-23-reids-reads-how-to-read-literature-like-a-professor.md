<p>the world around me. </p>
<p>A wonderful insight into the true value of fictive works, looking into the meaning and choices an author makes when writing, the Great Story that all works both derive from and add to, and the symbolism that gives works a deeper meaning. If you were someone who thought fiction was a waste of your time, like myself, this work will give you an appreciation and an understanding of the lessons you are missing out on. The lessons in this book might even give you an eye for spotting the hidden meaning in a work and a mind to start reading more literature.</p>
