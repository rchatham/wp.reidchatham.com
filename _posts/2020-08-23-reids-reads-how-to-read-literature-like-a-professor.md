<p>A lot of this book was over my head with too many references to literature with which I am unfamiliar to hit home, but what did, gave me a new appreciation for fiction, what didn't gave me a strong curiosity for authors that I may have discounted or ignored as not offering insight into the world around me. </p>
<p>When the book wasn’t throwing out references fast enough to make my head spin, which I must say was done eloquently enough to be at least readable, it helped to give me a new understanding of the references that I often saw not in literature, but in TV, movies, plays, and art giving me a new appreciation and a new way to look at some of my favorite fictive art forms. This book no doubt gave me an appreciation for the historical impact of fiction and its commentary on the world we live in and the times, location, mindsets, and politics of the writers. </p>
<p>When the book was tossing authors out that I was unfamiliar with it did get a bit tiresome and lost in translation but also gave me a bit of a kick in the pants to get to reading more fiction and perhaps with a bit more respect for the authors that wrote them. I certainly will order a few Hemingway novels and see how reading them goes, I will let you know.</p>
<p>If nothing more than a history of literature and how it has affected culture, this is a great read, and if an inspiration to read more fiction, it offers a great insight into where to look for great classics and the historical significance of the authors and their cultural commentary. </p>
