<p>I recently came across an issue in the interoperability of two Objective-C APIâ€™s that I was using from a Swift app. One was known to be rewritten in Swift soon but was very trusted and widely used (JSQMessagesViewController) while the other a much smaller but also well tested framework that had not been updated in a long time (VENTokenField). I wanted to use these two frameworks together to create a new message interface much like the one in the standard messages app but due to a few features they could not be directly used together in the situation in part because of a bug that was going to take a massive amount of fiddling to work around.
I took a good long look at the situation at hand. JSQMessagesViewControllerâ€™s keyboard observer looks for a UITextView as opposed to VENTokenPicker using a UITextField and so to have the toolbar follow the keyboard properly I was either going to have to work a UITextView into the inner workings of the VENTokenPicker or I was going to have to do the reverse with the keyboard observer.
Needless to say, I wanted to do it in Swift because my app was in Swift. I looked at the total code and figured the VENTokenPicker could be rewritten in a total of 3 files in Swift. The whole initial go took 1 day of my time to get it working and another day to smooth out most of the bugs and get the final touches right. I thought not bad. In that time I fixed the bug, rewrote a good but old Objective-C library that wasnâ€™t getting much love into a new Swift one, converted the UITextField into a UITextView (arguably the more correct option), did not have to fiddle significantly with JSQMessagesViewController as the alternative option wouldâ€™ve forced me to do, and get to feel good about myself as a member of the open source community (<strong>pat myself on the back</strong>).
Now, there are a lot of hiccups when converting code from Objective-C to Swift but at the very least this exercise will give you a better understanding of the differences between the languages and at best make you look like a Swift hero ðŸ¤—! I expect if you translated something directly as closely as you could translate it from Objective-C to Swift it would crash immediatelyâ€¦. but keep going, you got this!!!
